# cave-generation
- Generating random cave levels for games (using cellular automata).

### generate_cave.py
- The levels will generate differently depending on the values of *GRID_SIZE*, *INITIAL_CHANCE*, *NUMBER_OF_STEPS*, *BIRTH_LIMIT* and *DEATH_LIMIT*.

- By default returns a *GRID_SIZE*Ã—*GRID_SIZE* matrix of 1-s and 0-s

### display_cave.py
- The single purpose of this file is just to display the generated outcome
